    "# Tutorial 1: `GenomicRanges` and range-based analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "Genomic range operations are fundamental to many bioinformatics analyses. They allow us to work with intervals of genomic coordinates, which is crucial for understanding the relationships between different genomic features such as genes, regulatory elements, and experimental data like ChIP-seq peaks. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to work with genomic interval data using BiocPy's [GenomicRanges](https://github.com/BiocPy/GenomicRanges/) package, which provides Python implementations similar to the R/Bioconductor [GenomicRanges package](https://github.com/Bioconductor/GenomicRanges).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we'll walk through several key aspects of working with genomic ranges in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading Genomic Data: We'll start by reading in genomic data from RDS files, including exon positions grouped by transcripts.\n",
    "2. Basic Genomic Operations: We'll cover fundamental operations like finding transcription start sites (TSS) and promoter regions.\n",
    "3. Overlap Analysis: We'll learn how to find overlaps between different genomic features, a common task in many analyses.\n",
    "4. Advanced Operations: We'll explore more complex operations like finding peaks within specific regions and resizing genomic intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",

    "Before we begin, please ensure that you have the following packages installed:"

    "Resizing and shifting genomic ranges can be useful in various contexts. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Narrowing peaks might help focus on the center of ChIP-seq binding sites.\n",
    "- Shifting ranges can be used to look at regions adjacent to your features of interest. e.g. defining the predicted CRISPR cleavage site based on the position of the CRISPR gRNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations demonstrate the flexibility of genomic range manipulations, which can be useful for fine-tuning analyses or testing hypotheses about the spatial relationships between genomic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the average width of the ChIP-seq peaks on chromosome 22.\n",
    "2. Determine how many peaks overlap with CpG islands.\n",
    "3. Compute the percentage of promoter regions that have at least one overlapping ChIP-seq peak.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've explored how to use BiocPy's genomic ranges functionality to perform various genomic analyses. These tools and techniques provide a powerful way to work with genomic interval data in Python, mirroring the capabilities from Bioconductor. They form the foundation for many more complex genomic analyses and can be applied to a wide range of biological questions.\n",
