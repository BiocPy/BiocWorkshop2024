# Welcome

Welcome to our workshop on exploring the data structures and packages 
available in [BiocPy](https://github.com/biocpy), a project that brings 
the power of Bioconductor to Python. 

In this workshop, we will focus on interoperability between R and Python, covering two main topics:

- Reading an RDS file containing `GenomicRanges` and performing downstream range-based analyses.
- Annotating single-cell RNA-seq data analysis using the [scrnaseq](https://github.com/biocpy/scrnaseq) package.

Attendees will learn how to represent and manipulate their datasets in Python 
in the same manner as in R/Bioconductor. 
All packages in BiocPy are published to PyPI, and the code is open-source 
on [GitHub](https://github.com/BiocPy).
