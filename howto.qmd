# How to run the notebooks

## Option 1: Run notebooks locally

If you want to run locally, please clone the repository and install the python packages used for the workshop.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocWorkshop2024
cd BiocWorkshop2024

# Assuming python is available
# You are free to use mamba, conda or virtualenv's
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the jupyter server
jupyter lab
```

Then checkout the [notebook](https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocWorkshop2024/tree/master/notebook) directory that contain Jupyter notebooks.

## Option 2: Using Google colab

To open the session in Google colab

1. Open [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in a new tab.
2. On the page, It should open up a dialog to "Open notebook" as shown in the screenshot below. If not, go to file -> Open Notebook from the menu in the top left.
3. Choose Github and enter the repository url for the workshop: `https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocWorkshop2024`. This will automatically find the python notebooks available in the repository.

This process does not download the [RDS file](https://github.com/BiocPy/BiocWorkshop2024/tree/master/notebook) available in the repository. Folks might have to manually download this to their colab sessions.
